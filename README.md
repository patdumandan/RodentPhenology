[Paper](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ecy.4160) now published in Ecology titled: Shifts in competitive structures drive variation in speciesâ€™ phenology published in Ecology 

#### Goals:  

1. to describe the breeding phenology of desert rodents under different biotic contexts; and   
2. to determine the effects of abiotic (i.e., NDVI, weather variables) and biotic (i.e., biomass of competitors) factors on their breeding phenology 

#### Folders:  

1. analyses: all files related to exploratory/preliminary analyses (unorganized and poorly annotated)  
2. figures: some of the manuscript figures  
3. RScripts: all final data cleaning and data analyses scripts  
4. ReproData: cleaned reproductive data used in building models  

#### Relevant scripts:  

1. data_curation_final.R: obtain cleaned and manipulated Portal rodent data and relevant covariates 
2. data_cleaning_function_Supp.R: Sarah's code for cleaning individual-level data (to make sure all records of reproductive individuals are correct)  
3. explore-lag models.R: used to determine the appropriate lag for weather covariates (warm and cool precip)  
4. figure_prep.R: code for creating manuscript figures
