# Reproductive Phenology
## PhD project 1: reproductive phenology of rodents in Portal

#### Goals:  

1. to describe the breeding phenology of desert rodents under different biotic contexts; and   
2. to determine the effects of abiotic (i.e., NDVI, weather variables) and biotic (i.e., biomass of competitors) factors on their breeding phenology 

#### Folders:  

1. exploratory: all preliminary analyses codes (unorganized and poorly annotated)  
2. figures: some of the manuscript figures  
3. RScripts: all final data cleaning and data analyses scripts
